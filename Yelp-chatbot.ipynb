      "This is a cozy sandwich shop with a great menu. Lots of sandwich choices both meat and vegetarian, and all stuff that sounded really interesting. This also had some delicious-looking baked goods and a full coffee/tea bar. I visited for lunch and got a vegetarian muffuletta melt, one of their seasonal specials, a matcha white chocolate cookie, and a blood orange tea. The vegetarian muffuletta was essentially an olive salad melt. It was pretty oily but very tasty. Love the bread! The cookie was big and decadent - a matcha cookie with white choc chips topped with matcha frosting  - I would've considered it complete without the frosting but the frosting was still a treat! The cookie was nice and soft with a pleasant matcha flavour. The tea was very good too. The prices are definitely fair - I found the food very filling and the quality was great.There's lots of seating inside the shop if you want to dine in, and the place is comfortable. They pack everything to go by default, make sure to specify if you don't need a bag.\n",

Yum!!Meal specs:They give you a grilled chicken breast cut into strips. They put walnuts, cranberries and (I believe) blue cheese. I choose against any cheese. However, you can substitute as I have before. Also, I get the cranberries on the side. I've had too many before. For the dressing I got the balsamic vinaigrette. Tip: If you order to go make sure that you check that they give you the dressing!! They often forget!This meal is a typical chicken salad meal. Nothing fancy!! The salad wouldn't be enough after working out @ the gym for as long as I did (1hr 25min). So, I got a shake after my shower!Drink specs: Since it's from another place you'd have to check their review!Bon appétit!!! Picture\n",

Their baked goods (specifically the lemon bar) tends to disappear by mid afternoon, so get there early.One star down because I'm not a huge fan of their food. They have a ton of options for people who have gluten allergies, are dairy free or are vegetarian/vegan so props to them, but nothing shouts \"OMG\" to me.TIP: Their baker doesn't come in on Sunday so by then.. most of the sweets are either gone or a day old. :(\n",

The downside is that the establishment gets my order wrong about 70% of the time. Whether our office calls to order over the phone or I walk in to place my order, consistently something is not correct. Everything is also very chaotic and hectic during lunch. The design of the space is not suited for the type of business where so many people get things to go and there is no comfortable room to wait for your order to be called when it's busy. Most of the staff doesn't seem to know what's in the items or how they are served but they will ask to find out sometimes, and other times they just take a guess and that's that.

      "I'm not trying to knock this place in any way, but I was not impressed at all.  First off, I did not dine in here, I called in an order and stopped to pick it up.  The space itself is unique, very colorful, and definitely not like any other place I have been in the city.  The order I called in was a rather larger order so I expected that there would be a little wait.  When I showed up on Craig St. I was surprised to find a nearby street parking space and not have to circle several times.  But that did not matter, my order still wasn't even started by the time that I was quoted the order to be ready.  Then add into that the fact that when I called in the order and by the time they started to prepare the order, the soup of the day was out.  So instead of setting aside the soup for our order, they sold it to someone that ordered after us.  To say the girl that was running the register was frazzled is an understatement.  She literally was running around.  I think that she was new or inexperienced, and that was unsettling.  Especially when she went to make a cappuccino and didn't know how to steam the milk or how to pour the milk into the espresso.  Then when it came to getting the orders comprised and ready to go, my order was split between another lady's order.  Even though I was being rushed to leave and make space at the counter I'm glad I looked at my order before I left.  Why?  Because it still wasn't correct.Anyway, enough with that, let's talk about the food.  I ordered the Spicy Grilled Cheese and Bacon with a small bowl of Cream of Tomato with Feta and Basil.  The grilled cheese was definitely the star of the day.  The soup on the other hand was extremely salty and I could not finish it.  To sum it up, This place really did make eating unique, and not in a good way.\n",

The only thing that sort of bothered me was the fact that the service didn't seem to even know what was on the menu or what I was ordering when I asked questions. At first, I thought it was just my order, but someone else came in right after me and asked some questions and also got the same blank stare and \"I don't know\" response. I got a grilled veggie wrap and it was decent. A little greasy (but I was expecting that from a deli style place like this) but it was satisfying enough to make a dinner out of.  It looked like their baked goods were pretty popular (saw a few vegan things which was nice!) but I didn't get the chance to try any. Like I said, for a college town, this is a pretty great place to eat. I'd also imagine it was a really nice place to study as well.

I normally get the half-sandwich/half-soup combo, but their sandwich options for the combo are pretty limited. Their chicken pesto sandwich is decent, but it can get pricey especially if you get it with a soup.The biggest downside I can think of is the inconsistency in wait time. Depending on how many people ordered and how many people called in, the wait can take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes. The layout of the place is also a bit weird; you can't really hear the number of your order from the tables, so many people crowd by the counter where food comes out, which is right next to the cashier. As a result, it gets super crowded around an already small area. Everything's great once you get your food, but the ordering and waiting process can definitely be refined.\n",

I think it had pepper jack and cheddar cheese, tomato, and banana peppers.  There was supposed to be bacon, but it was either a negligible amount or they forgot it.  Maybe I was starving, but this sandwich was great.  I really loved the combination and the price is so fair.  Panera charges twice that for some of their sandwiches.This place gets crazy at lunch time.  I think I waited about ten minutes, which is ok.  If I ever forget my lunch again, I'll be back!\n",

      "My only regret about this place is that I never came here when I was a student. It was so good!Yes, the check-out space wasn't designed very well and often results in human traffic jams. Yes, the food costs more than you'd want it to here. But c'mon: EVERY place costs more than I want it to, and as someone else pointed out: Eat Unique's prices compare to Panera's, only Eat Unique's food tastes even better (and I say this as a solid Panera fan). There's a ton of seating options in here, too, so before you complain, just think about how many fewer tables there may have been if they knocked out a wall to try and expand the line area.I had the Grilled Pesto Chicken sandwich during my first visit in an effort to avoid some of the \"unhealthier\" options on the menu and have to say, I was very, very pleased. It's very rare that I get a sandwich that perfectly balances toppings and meat; usually I get too much of one or the other. Plus, the toppings were crisp and fresh, and the chicken well cooked. Not the juiciest chicken ever but not dry by any means. It was right on, it hit the spot, and it left me feeling satisfied and yet ready for more. Don't worry: I was good and opted to keep the place in mind for another day, rather than pig out on a second sandwich. I am already excited to come back and try many, many more options on the menu, including the veggie and the beef and brie sandwiches. I may eventually get to the soup and salad options, but those sandwiches, man...they're calling to me!\n",

      "The chilly, rainy weather today put me in the mood for some nice hot homemade soup. However, it also deterred me from going to the Strip to get it, so I decided to head down the street instead to Eat Unique.I must admit that after having picked up an unimpressive sandwich (don't remember which) from here a couple of years ago before a trip, I'd been hesitant to patronize this place again.  Having reviewed other Yelpers' comments, I decided to opt for a small tomato basil feta soup and the pesto chicken sandwich, which came to slightly over $10 together.  Because I went today (Sat.), it wasn't very busy, and I didn't encounter any confusion or hostility when ordering.  After ordering, my food took about 5 min. to prepare. Since I live nearby, I took it back to my apt. to consume.The tomato soup, which was reasonably warm, although not quite as hot as I'd like it, was pretty good, albeit not mind-blowing.  The sandwich was solidly okay, and not as flavorful as I would have liked, esp. for something containing pesto.  Although it stayed together fairly well, the ingredients slid around a fair bit, and it cooled off pretty quickly, to the point that I put the second half in the microwave before eating it.While the food was solidly okay, esp. for deli food in PGH, I've had better.  I prefer to patronize independent local businesses over chains, but I'd say the food is a step up from Subway, but doesn't quite meet the standard of the food at Panera.\n",

The wait times can be extremely long so call ahead for your order if you can. The line can also get out of hand because folks don't properly know how to queue once they've placed their order. Be sure to go to the back counter and ask for a soup sample before buying--they say they make their soups daily but I've definitely had an old batch or two of chili that was clearly a few days old. When it's fresh, it's great. But when it's not it's the absolute worst.I'd be more inclined to give this place another star if everything was simply $1 cheaper, but since I work nearby I'm sure I'll be back for another $12 lunch soon.\n",

I'm fairly certain their soup is made from scratch daily. I can't give Eat Unique five stars because every time I go there for lunch I'm under extreme duress.

The extra fee is not what I'm upset about; I am use to being charged to have a gluten free substitute. What stunned me was the portion size. As you can see in the picture, the \"small soup\" I ordered is BIGGER than my sandwich. Inside my sandwich included ONE slice of tomato,ONE slice of Mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 of a cup of lettuce. If I am going to be charged extra for gluten free, make the inside of the sandwich the equivalent of a regular sandwich. COMPLETE RIPOFF.

I really liked the bread that the sandwich is made on, but not quite sure what the name of it is.

Seriously, though, even my grilled cheese sandwich tasted bad--how do you mess up a grilled cheese sandwich?And their coffee is too weak.I agree with the person who said it's cute inside. I think that's why I've given them so many chances. But food that's just not that good--combined with high prices--means I'm not going back.\n",

      "Eat Unique has a great menu full of unique sandwiches and salads that leaves Panera in the dust. I finally made it out to the cafe for lunch today and had an overall good experience.The only negative part of my lunch was that my girlfriend asked for American cheese on her sandwich rather than the normal bleu cheese. They ended up giving her a corner of a piece of American as well as bleu cheese. It's a shame that they couldn't get such a simple request right, especially since we arrived at 1:30 and the lunch crowd was gone. I also ordered a pecan bar and did not receive it, I went back to the cashier and she gave me one. Reading similar negative comments regarding accuracy with ordering makes me think it's something they should work on.The food was excellent, however. I got the Italian sub and it was full of fresh spring greens rather than the usual shredded ice berg lettuce. I also tried their white turkey chili and it was excellent as well.My girlfriend managed to pick most of the bleu cheese off of her meatloaf melt and said it was really good. She also had the tomato feta and basil soup and enjoyed it.The pecan bar was a flaky crust, a kind of dense chocolate ganache and a pecan topping similar to a pecan pie. It was really good.The food at Eat Unique seems to be fresh and in plentiful portions. We'd definitely go back. I hope they get their ordering accuracy in better shape, though.\n",

      "At the end of the day, this is your run-of-the-mill cafe. If you don't come here expecting a meal that will blow your mind, you'll be fine, but with a name like \"Eat Unique\", I expected better.I've had the chance to try a couple salads and sandwiches from here and while all have been fine, none would make me want to come back for more. If you're not in the mood for some of the more ethnic dishes Craig has to offer, this is a fine option for a quick sandwich, but there's nothing really unique about it. As a plus for vegetarians, they have a slew of vegetarian and vegan options that could be great for people who can't find another accommodating place on Craig\n",
      "None\n",
      "The food I've had here has been pretty good -- mostly I've had their salads which seem fresh and tasty. The prices are a bit high for a lunch spot, but it's not a bad option once in a while. This appears to be one of the healthier places on Craig Street.\n",

So it's crowded and you've to wait for quite some time after you place the order. They however do have a good variety of vegetarian sandwiches. Although I'm a non vegetarian I eat the veg sandwiches in eat unique because they really are that unique and interesting. Today we tried a zesty pineapple sandwich which was pretty yummy. We also ordered a hummus and avocado sandwich which was a little dry but it tasted fine. Their sandwiches are very filling, even the vegetarian ones.\n",

      "I'm not sure what's unique about this place. It certainly doesn't live up to any standard of local or innovative food, but it has some pretty tasty stuff.I had a Cobb Salad and a pumpkin bar/muffin thing. The pumpkin sweet? Awesome. I want to know how to make it myself.The Cobb salad was ok--lots of cheddar cheese, tasty shredded chicken, nice well-done bacon, and a hardboiled egg. All that was good. The guacamole was not fresh (tasted like the premade grocery store crap), which is a disappointment considering that guacamole is probably the easiest dish on the planet to make (avocado, salt, and a fork...where can it go wrong). I was left wanting a piece of bread with my salad.I also didn't like the plastic container it was served in. Those things activate my feelings of enviro-guilt. I would have preferred a ceramic or even paper plate and some metal utensils. However, the air conditioning was very welcome on a hot day so I'll forgive them for plastic.I will probably return for more pumpkin goodies, but I doubt the sandwiches and salads will bring me back.\n",

      "Expansive menu, great veggie and meat lover's options. Fresh soup of the day and Mel specials to mix it up a bit. I love their daily stand by of the White Chicken Chili. Hearty and has a bit of a kick to it. Black bean burger is the bomb, minus the goopy cheese. The sweet bean hummus was a wonderful surprise on a recent sandwich I had. Sometimes, I feel that it is a bit expensive for say a lunch meal but as the hubby. has pointed out, it us comparable in pricing to Panera, and much better. The desserts are not the goopy kind full of thick icing or heavy cream. Instead, large Sea Salt and Choco Chip cookies, Pumpkin bars, Thick and just a bit dry (the way I like 'em) Shortbread cookies adorn the dessert case.I like the adventure of going here. Trying new combos of ingredients is always a treat when you trust the culinary integrity of a place, like I do of Eat Unique\n",

So instead of setting aside the soup for our order, they sold it to someone that ordered after us.  To say the girl that was running the register was frazzled is an understatement.  She literally was running around.  I think that she was new or inexperienced, and that was unsettling.  Especially when she went to make a cappuccino and didn\\'t know how to steam the milk or how to pour the milk into the espresso.

I also tried their white turkey chili and it was excellent as well.My girlfriend managed to pick most of the bleu cheese off of her meatloaf melt and said it was really good. She also had the tomato feta and basil soup and enjoyed it.The pecan bar was a flaky crust, a kind of dense chocolate ganache and a pecan topping similar to a pecan pie. It was really good.The food at Eat Unique seems to be fresh and in plentiful portions. We\\'d definitely go back. I hope they get their ordering accuracy in better shape, though.\", \\'review_rating\\': None}, {\\'review_text\\': \\'At the end of the day, this is your run-of-the-mill cafe.

If you\\\\\\'re not in the mood for some of the more ethnic dishes Craig has to offer, this is a fine option for a quick sandwich, but there\\\\\\'s nothing really unique about it.

It certainly doesn\\'t live up to any standard of local or innovative food, but it has some pretty tasty stuff.I had a Cobb Salad and a pumpkin bar/muffin thing. The pumpkin sweet? Awesome. I want to know how to make it myself.The Cobb salad was ok--lots of cheddar cheese, tasty shredded chicken, nice well-done bacon, and a hardboiled egg. All that was good. The guacamole was not fresh (tasted like the premade grocery store crap), which is a disappointment considering that guacamole is probably the easiest dish on the planet to make (avocado, salt, and a fork...where can it go wrong). I was left wanting a piece of bread with my salad.I also didn\\'t like the plastic container it was served in. Those things activate my feelings of enviro-guilt. I would have preferred a ceramic or even paper plate and some metal utensils. However, the air conditioning was very welcome on a hot day so I\\'ll forgive them for plastic.I will probably return for more pumpkin goodies, but I doubt the sandwiches and salads will bring me back.\", \\'review_rating\\': None}, {\\'review_text\\': \"Expansive menu, great veggie and meat lover\\'s options. Fresh soup of the day and Mel specials to mix it up a bit. I love their daily stand by of the White Chicken Chili. Hearty and has a bit of a kick to it. Black bean burger is the bomb, minus the goopy cheese. The sweet bean hummus was a wonderful surprise on a recent sandwich I had. Sometimes, I feel that it is a bit expensive for say a lunch meal but as the hubby. has pointed out, it us comparable in pricing to Panera, and much better. The desserts are not the goopy kind full of thick icing or heavy cream. Instead, large Sea Salt and Choco Chip cookies, Pumpkin bars, Thick and just a bit dry (the way I like \\'em) Shortbread cookies adorn the dessert case.I like the adventure of going here.
